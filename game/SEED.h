/*===============================================================================

  System for Environmental Entity Distribution (SEED, formerly known as LODE)
  
  Automatically creates/culls entities based on distance from player.

  Can spawn entities based on templates in random places, or manage already
  existing entities. The rules where to spawn what are quite flexible, either
  random, with distribution functions, based on underlying texture etc.

  Inhibitors can also be placed, these inhibit spawning of either all entities
  from one class or all entitites.

  Can also combine spawned entities into "megamodels", where the model consists
  of all the surfaces of the combined models, plus a physics model with multiple
  clipmodels, to reduce entity count and number of drawcalls. These combined
  entities are of the CStaticMulti class.
