*
* DESCRIPTION: CRelations is a "relationship manager" that keeps track of and
* allows changes to the relationship between each team, including every
* AI team and the player team (team 0).
* Relationship values are integers.  negative is enemy, positive friend, zero
* neutral.  
*
* The larger the value, the more strongly an AI "cares" about the relationship.
* Large - value => will not rest until they've hunted down every last member
* of this team.  
* Large + value => these teams had best not forget their anniversary.
*
* Accessor methods should be made available to scripting, for relationship dependent
* scripts, and for changing the relationships on a map in realtime.
*
* TODO: Allow for "persistent relationships" that copy over between maps.
* This would be useful for T3-esque factions.  It might require a "faction ID"
* that is different from the "team ID" in the mapfile though.
*
