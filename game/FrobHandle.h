/**
 * CFrobHandle is a generic binary mover meant to be attached to other
 * entities like doors and froblocks. This is just a base class - there are
 * actual implementations like CFrobDoorHandle and CFrobLockHandle to be
 * used as handle for the corresponding classes CFrobDoor and CFrobLock.
 *
 * A frob handle re-routes the frob- and attack actions to its master entity.
 *
 * For instance: when frobbing a door with a handle attached, the event chain is like this:
 * Frob > Door::Open > Handle::Tap > Handle moves to open pos > Door::OpenDoor
