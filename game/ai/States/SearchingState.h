/**
* greebo: A SearchingState is handling the AI's search routines.
* 
* The routine needs "memory.alertPos" to be set as prerequisite.
*
* The boolean variable "memory.stimulusLocationItselfShouldBeSearched" can be used
* to let the AI the "memory.alertPos" position as first hiding spot.
* If the boolean is not set to TRUE, the hiding spot search is based around memory.alertPos.
*
* The actual hiding spot search algorithm is called over multiple
* frames. Once finished, the AI can use its results (unless the 
* stimulusLocationItselfShouldBeSearched bool is set to TRUE, then alertPos is used as
* first hiding spot right away.
*
* For each hiding spot, an InvestigateSpotTask is invoked which takes care of the details.
