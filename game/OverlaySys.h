/// Container class to keep track of multiple GUIs.
/**	An overlay system is used to keep track of an arbitrary number of GUIs.
 *	The overlay system consists of zero or more 'overlays'. An overlay
 *	contains a GUI and some bookkeeping information. Each overlay has a
 *	'layer' which is used to sort the order the overlays are drawn in.
 *	Overlays in higher layers are drawn on top of overlays in lower layers.
 *	Multiple overlays may exist in the same layer, but their drawing order
 *	with respect to eachother is undefined.
 *	
 *	An overlay may be opaque. If/when the overlay system is rendered directly
 *	to screen, this overlay is assumed to have no transparent sections, and
 *	nothing underneath it will be rendered. This has no effect on GUIs that
 *	are in the game-world.
 *	
 *	An overlay may be interactive. If the overlay system is asked which GUI
 *	interactivity should be routed to, it will return the GUI in the highest
 *	interactive overlay. This has no effect on GUIs that are in the
 *	game-world.
 *	
 *	An overlay may be external, meaning that its GUI points to a GUI defined
 *	externally. Note that although external overlays are saved and restored,
 *	their GUI pointer isn't, and needs to be set again.
 *	
 *	I'm assuming the overlay system will only be used to contain a few
 *	overlays at a time, so I've opted for simpler data structures and easier
 *	code, rather than trying to make the most efficient system possible.
 *	However, certain easy optimizatons have been made; although accessing a
 *	different overlay from last time is O(N) with respect to the number of
 *	overlays contained, repeatedly accessing the same overlay is very fast.
 *	Similarly, results relating to which layers are opaque/interactive are
 *	cached.
