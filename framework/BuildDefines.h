// =========================== memory debugging defines =======================
// note: you can temporarily modify them right here to enable/disable something

// Enables debug version of idHeap.
// All allocations via Mem_Alloc and the like are tagged with FILE/LINE data.
// It allows to:
//    1. "memoryDump" or "memoryDumpCompressed" --- dump all memory blocks used to file
//    2. after exit --- writes memory leaks to tdm_main_leak_size.txt
// Note: has additional effect when used with ID_REDIRECT_NEWDELETE (see below)
//#define ID_DEBUG_MEMORY

// Redirects standard C++ new/delete to Mem_Alloc and the like (which used idHeap).
// Defines global operator new/delete, so that normal allocations like "new CGrabber" go through idHeap too.
// Note: if both ID_REDIRECT_NEWDELETE and ID_DEBUG_MEMORY are defined,
// then "new" keyword is redefined with macro (needed to capture FILE/LINE info).
//#define ID_REDIRECT_NEWDELETE

// Enables debug guards against using uninitialized data.
// It does the following:
//    1. fills all idHeap-allocated memory with 0xCD trash
//    2. tries to detect which members of game objects (inherited from idClass) are not initialized properly
//#define ID_DEBUG_UNINITIALIZED_MEMORY

// Allows to use GameTypeInfo.h generated from game headers by TypeInfo parser.
// This makes functions declared in gamesys/TypeInfo.h work properly, and as the result:
//    1. text representation of game state is dumped to file when game is saved (and compared on load)
//    2. messages about uninitialized members show member names
//#define ID_USE_TYPEINFO

// P.S. The following features always work:
//    "com_showMemoryUsage 1" --- display memory usage stats on screen
// ============================================================================

// if enabled, the console won't toggle upon ~, unless you start the binary with +set com_allowConsole 1
// Ctrl+Alt+~ will always toggle the console no matter what
