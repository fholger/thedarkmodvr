# explanation of package types:
#   * header
#       these deps are header-only, hence they don't need per-configuration builds
#   * release
#       these deps can be built only once in release mode, and then used both in release and debug builds
#       this is possible only for pure C libraries built with /MT, and needs /nodefaultlib:LIBCMT.lib flag in debug build
#   * vcdebug
#       these deps must be built separately for each configuration on MSVC (both debug and release)
#       this is required for C++ libs because iterator debugging and runtime differences are not allowed by MSVC
